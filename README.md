# Professional Background

As a graduate student pursuing my master's degree while actively working in software development, I bring a unique perspective that bridges academic research with industry experience. My professional journey spans multiple software companies, where I've contributed to diverse projects that have enriched my understanding of both theoretical principles and practical implementations.
My passion for innovation extends beyond traditional applications, with a particular interest in defense-oriented technologies and military applications of AI systems. While I maintain an academic focus on pushing the boundaries of AI and software engineering, I approach these fields with practical insights gained from real-world software development experience.
This repository reflects my commitment to understanding and explaining complex technological concepts, drawing from both my academic research and hands-on development experience. I aim to create content that serves both theoretical understanding and practical implementation needs.
